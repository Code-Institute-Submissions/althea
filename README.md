# ALTHEA ONLINE STORE

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create an e-commerce website for our "Sari-Sari" or small Store in our Municipality. Due to the unending community lockdowns we have in our province, most of our regular consumers are not able to go to our Store physically to buy their usual needs. Thus, I came up with an idea of an e-commerce site selling the same products we have from our stockrooms but this time we will deliver it to their doorsteps for everyone's safety and convenience. 

In reality though most or all of our customers will prefer either cash on delivery payments but for the purpose of the project only card payments will be accepted. 

For this project, I will be using python and Django as my primary programming language and html, CSS, JavaScript and bootstrap4 for the front end.
